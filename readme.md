# Simple_PE_packer #

The project was upgraded from https://coder.pub/ and supported VS2017. 
The original author wrote the detailed design ideas documentation--["Developing PE file packer step-by-step"](https://coder.pub/2014/10/pe-file-packer-step-by-step-step-12-bugfixes/).  
I think that if you look at this document carefully, you can understand  every technical detail clearly.
